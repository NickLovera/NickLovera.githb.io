	<p>Hi!<br><br>
	
		I am currently a back-end developer for Centene as a MThree Consultant<br>
		I have a Bachelors in Computer Science from Texas Tech Univeristy and graduated in Decemeber of 2020<br>
		This is my crappy little website that i work on in my free time as a place to store some random projects i have done as well as work on my front-end skills (That clearly need it)<br><br>
		Have a look around at some of my code and have a great day.
