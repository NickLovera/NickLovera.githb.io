    <h1>Save The Prisoner</h1>
    <p>
    A jail has a number of prisoners and a number of treats to pass out to them. Their jailer decides the fairest way to divide the <br>
    treats is to seat the prisoners around a circular table in sequentially numbered chairs. A chair number will be drawn from a hat. <br>
    Beginning with the prisoner in that chair, one candy will be handed to each prisoner sequentially around the table until all have been distributed. <br><br>

    The jailer is playing a little joke, though. The last piece of candy looks like all the others, but it tastes awful. Determine the chair <br>
    number occupied by the prisoner who will receive that candy.<br><br>

    The first line contains an integer, , the number of test cases.
    The next  lines each contain  space-separated integers:

    n: the number of prisoners
    m: the number of sweets
    s: the chair number to start passing out treats at
