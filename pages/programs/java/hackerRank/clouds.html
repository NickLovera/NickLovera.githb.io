    <h1>Jumping On Clouds</h1>
    <pre><code class="java">
//A child is playing a cloud hopping game. In this game, 
//there are sequentially numbered clouds that can be thunderheads or cumulus clouds.
//The character must jump from cloud to cloud until it reaches the start again.
//There is an array of clouds, c and an energy level e = 100.
//he character starts from c[0] and uses 1 unit of energy to make a jump of size k. to cloud c[(i+k)k%n].
//if it lands on a thundercloud, c[i] = 1, its energy (e) decreases by 2 additional units. The game ends when the character lands back on cloud 0. 
//Given the values of n, k, and the configuration of the clouds as an array c, determine the final value of e after the game ends.
